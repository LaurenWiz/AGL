## Overview
R markdown is a powerful tool for generating reports, webpages, interactive tools, etc with embedded R code.  This document is an Rmarkdown document and is intended to demonstrate some of the potential opportunities of this technology for the Alliance for the Great Lakes Beach Litter Data

We have two goals:

*1 To generate an interactive web portal for finding and extracting beack litter cleanup data
*2 To produce a predictive model for the type and abundance of beach litter for any given site
